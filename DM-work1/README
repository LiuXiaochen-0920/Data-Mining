# 互评作业1: 数据探索性分析与数据预处理

### 1. 问题描述
本次作业中，自行选择2个数据集进行探索性分析与预处理。
### 2. 数据集
所选数据集为：<br>  
* [Wine Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)
* [Chicago Building Violations](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-building-violations)

### 3. 数据分析要求
#### 3.1 数据可视化和摘要
* 数据摘要<br> 
标称属性，给出每个可能聚会的频数<br> 
数值属性，给出5数概括及缺失值的个数<br> 

* 数据可视化<br> 
使用直方图、盒图等检查数据分布及离群点<br> 

#### 3.2 数据缺失的处理
观察数据集中缺失数据，分析其缺失的原因。分别使用下列四种策略对缺失值进行处理:<br> 

* 将缺失部分剔除
* 用最高频率值来填补缺失值
* 通过属性的相关关系来填补缺失值
* 通过数据对象之间的相似性来填补缺失值<br> 
注意：在处理后，要可视化地对比新旧数据集。<br> 

# 数据集
## 1 [Wine Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) <br> 
130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description<br> 

### Description
#### Context
After watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!

#### Content
This dataset contains three files:<br> 
* winemag-data-130k-v2.csv contains 10 columns and 130k rows of wine reviews.
* winemag-data_first150k.csv contains 10 columns and 150k rows of wine reviews. 
* winemag-data-130k-v2.json contains 6919 nodes of wine reviews.
