## 作业说明 
### 1. 问题描述
本次作业中，将从下面的3个问题中任选一个进行。

### 2. 可选问题
#### 数据集-Hotel booking demand
该数据集包含城市酒店和度假酒店的预订信息，包括预订时间、停留时间，成人/儿童/婴儿人数以及可用停车位数量等信息。
数据量：32列共12W数据。

基于这个数据集，可进行以下问题的探索：

* 基本情况：城市酒店和假日酒店预订需求和入住率比较；  
* 用户行为：提前预订时间、入住时长、预订间隔、餐食预订情况；  
* 一年中最佳预订酒店时间；

#### Context
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

#### Content
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

#### Acknowledgements
The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020.
